# language-app

loading screen
    - small animation and/or logo before user is directed to the home screen. minimal design, transition into actual app

login/reg screen
    - prompt user to log in and then have option below "not already a user? register now"
    - wont get technical for now. used to pass in name.
    - potentially use SQL to add a database and validation.

language screen (only if you dont already have an account)
    - prompt user to select a language
    - have one functional language for now (spanish) add in others for aesthetics and future functionality

home screen
    - welcome {name of user}
    - progress bar


profile screen


*questions for self
    - what type of data do we want to maintain for the users who are logged in? name, progress (how far the user got in their language completion before they logged out), 

    - how do we join/combine SQL code and React code?
